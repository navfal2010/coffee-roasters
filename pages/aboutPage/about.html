        <p class="coffee_began">Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999, highlighting stories of
          coffee from around the world. We have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew - in
          every shipment.</p>

        <p class="were_built">Were built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to
          make it easy for you to discover and brew the worlds best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To
          locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the
          challenges and initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the finest blends, we roast each
          lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing region.</p>

        <p class="although_we">Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and
          processing, we employ, on
          our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of
          coffee
          is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that
          brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
